\section{Description and justification}

\textcolor{magenta}{2 pages max for description only}

\textcolor{magenta}{- Goal to wide context in MT.} 

\textcolor{magenta}{- Lots of work on context-wide MT, but community is lacking cohesion somehow.}

\textcolor{magenta}{- Goal to promote that people work on the same body of resources: those on the repository https://bitbucket.org/hy-crossNLP/discomt/wiki/Home } 

\textcolor{magenta}{- Weight on more linguistic stuff}

\textcolor{magenta}{- Throw out rule-based, start history with SMT, add paragraph what's going on on NMT}

\textcolor{magenta}{- Work on MT evaluation through test suites that has been going on}

\textcolor{magenta}{- Human parity discussion that has been going on }

\textcolor{magenta}{- Idea of invited speakers: invite them, funding... Potential names: Kellie Webster (Google), Andy Way (Dublin)}

When translating entire texts, as opposed to individual sentences only, 
one cannot ignore text-level properties. This is becoming increasingly
clear in neural machine translation (NMT), where text-level aspects of
translation may now be the main obstacle to high-quality automatic
translation for high-resource languages after the advances in translation
quality observed in recent years.\footnote{Samuel Läubli, Rico Sennrich
and Martin Volk. Has machine translation achieved human parity? A case
for document-level evaluation. Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on
Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing.} Approaches to this
probl

\begin{itemize}
\item document-wide properties, such as style, register,
  reading level and genre, all of which are manifest in the frequency
  and distribution of words, word senses, referential forms and
  syntactic structures; 
\item patterns of topical or functional sub-structure that show up
   in local differences in frequency and distribution;
\item patterns of discourse coherence, manifest in explicit and
  implicit relations between sentences (clauses), or between
  sentences (clauses) and referring forms, or between referring forms
  themselves (which include noun phrases and pronouns);
\item common use of short context-sensitive expressions that rely on
  context to convey a lot of information in very few words.
\end{itemize}

In the 1990s, these properties had stimulated considerable research in
Machine Translation, aimed at endowing machine-translated texts with
similar document and discourse properties as their source texts.
This included work on stylistics for MT, target language realization of 
source-language discourse
relations and of referring forms, anaphor resolution for generating
appropriate target-language pronouns, and ellipsis
resolution for generating appropriate target-language forms from
ellipsed verb-phrases. Pointers to much of this work can
be found in the \textit{Machine Translation Archive} of conference
and workshop papers from the 1990s (\url{http://www.mt-archive.info/srch/ling-90.htm}).

This early period essentially ended with the 1999 publication of a special
issue of the journal \textit{Machine Translation}, edited by Ruslan Mitkov,
devoted to anaphora resolution in Machine Translation and multi-lingual NLP.
A period of ten years then elapsed before interest resumed in these topics,
now from the perspectives of Statistical and/or Hybrid Machine
Translation.  

Since 2010, there has
been considerably more work on discourse and machine translation, by 
an increasing number of people and groups. Moreover, SMT
has itself evolved in ways that allow more access to needed linguistic knowledge,
through the feature-rich statistical models that have recently become available.
The branch of \textit{document-level machine translation} is
now well established, thanks in particular to the first two editions of
the DiscoMT (in 2013 and 2015). 

Considerable effort has been expended recently on document-level MT, such that now, several
individuals and/or groups are working on similar or overlapping problems.
Notable efforts include work on document-level influences on lexical choice in SMT, methods of document-level
SMT, annotated resources for discourse-level SMT, discourse factors affecting translation quality,
discourse-sensitive assessment metrics, and specific discourse phenomena in SMT.

As exemplified by the papers presented at DiscoMT 2015, active research topics in document-level MT are: 
pronoun translation between languages which differ in pronoun usage; 
explicitation/implicitation in translating discourse connectives; 
context-aware translation of ambiguous terms; assessing document-level properties of MT
output, including coherence; preserving document-level
properties characteristic of register, genre, and other types of text variation; and difficulties 
in preserving them in a purely alignment-based MT framework.

A critical mass of researchers for the DiscoMT 2015 and the WMT 2016 shared tasks
on pronoun-focused translation has been reached.  The advent of neural machine 
translation in the past two years has opened new opportunities for modeling 
text-level properties with deep neural networks, and we expect to see a number
of results presented and discussed at DiscoMT 2017.

The growing interest in discourse and MT led to the first
\textit{ACL Workshop on Discourse in Machine Translation (DiscoMT)} in 2013,
held in Sofia, Bulgaria.\footnote{Bonnie Webber  and  Andrei Popescu-Belis  and  Katja Markert  and  J\"{o}rg Tiedemann. (2013). \textit{Proceedings of the Workshop on Discourse in Machine Translation (DiscoMT)}. Sofia, Bulgaria. Association for Computational Linguistics. \url{http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W13-33}.}
The workshop
featured eight papers on such topics as lexical consistency in human and
machine translation, lexical tightness as a whole-document
measure of machine-translated targets, improving
the translation of tensed verbs by recognizing whether or not they are
conveying narrative, and document-level decoding.  For the first edition,
there were 12 submissions, 6 of which were accepted as oral presentations and
2 as posters only.  Oral presenters were also encouraged to make posters
describing their work, and all resulting posters were presented in joint
poster session with WMT 2013, thus offering DiscoMT an increased visibility.

To allow for sufficient novelty and volume of research contributions, the
organizers decided to hold DiscoMT every two years.  For the second
\textit{EMNLP Workshop on Discourse in Machine Translation (DiscoMT 2015)},
held in Lisbon, Portugal,\footnote{Webber, B., Carpuat, M., Popescu-Belis, A., \& Hardmeier, C. (2015). \textit{Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Discourse in Machine Translation (DiscoMT 2015)}. Lisbon, Portugal. Association for Computational Linguistics.  \url{https://aclweb.org/anthology/W/W15/\#2500}.}, the number of submitted and accepted paper had increased.  We maintained the idea of a joint poster session with WMT.  Out of 15 submissions,
5 were accepted as long papers, 3 as short papers, and 4 as posters only.  Moreover, nine papers described shared task submissions and an overview of the two sub-tasks of the shared task.

\section{Shared tasks: DiscoMT 2015, WMT 2016, and DiscoMT 2017}

Pronoun translation is a problem that has been independently approached
by different researchers in the last few years, which led to the organization of two shared tasks, in 2015 and 2016.
Incorrect pronoun translations can have a large impact on the readability
of a text, and the overuse of masculine default pronouns in MT output is not
only a linguistic, but also a gender-political issue.
Pronoun use is governed by strong grammatical rules, so it is relatively
straightforward to evaluate system performance objectively. Finally, the
importance of the problem is easy to demonstrate, even to an audience that is
ignorant of discourse.

The DiscoMT 2015 shared task\footnote{Christian Hardmeier, Preslav Nakov, Sara Stymne, Jörg Tiedemann, Yannick Versley, and Mauro Cettolo. (2015). Pronoun-Focused MT and Cross-Lingual Pronoun Prediction: Findings of the 2015 DiscoMT Shared Task on Pronoun Translation.  \textit{Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Discourse in Machine Translation (DiscoMT)}, pages 1–16, Lisbon, Portugal, 17 September 2015.  Association for Computational Linguistics.}
included two subtasks, relevant to both the machine translation and the discourse communities: (i)~pronoun-focused translation, a practical
MT task, and (ii)~cross-lingual pronoun prediction, a classification task that required no specific MT expertise and is interesting as a machine learning task in its own right. The task focused on EN/FR, for which MT output is generally of high quality, but has visible issues with pronoun translation due
to differences in the pronoun systems of the two languages. Six groups participated in the pronoun-focused translation task and eight groups in the cross-lingual pronoun prediction task.

The WMT 2016 shared task on cross-lingual pronoun prediction\footnote{Guillou, Liane; Hardmeier, Christian; Nakov, Preslav; Stymne, Sara; Tiedemann, Jörg; Versley, Yannick; Cettolo, Mauro; Webber, Bonnie; Popescu-Belis, Andrei. (2016).  Findings of the 2016 WMT shared task on cross-lingual pronoun prediction, \textit{Proceedings of the First Conference on Machine Translation (WMT16)}, pages 522-539.  Berlin, Germany. Association for Computational Linguistics. \url{https://aclweb.org/anthology/W/W16/W16-2345.pdf}}
was a  classification  task  in which  participants  were  asked  to  provide predictions  on  what  pronoun  class  label should replace a placeholder value in the target-language  text,  provided  in  lemmatised and PoS-tagged form.  Four subtasks were offered, for EN/FR and EN/DE language  pairs,  in  both directions.   Eleven  teams  participated  in the  shared  task. Most of the submissions outperformed two strong language-model-based baseline systems, with systems using deep recurrent neural networks outperforming those using other architectures for most language pairs.

We foresee the organization of a shared task on pronoun translation at DiscoMT 2017.  Minutes have been taken after the concluding discussion at the WMT 2016 shared task, and plans have been made for a 2017 shared task.  The idea is to maintain a sub-task on EN/FR/DE pronoun prediction (given the source text and a lemmatized (or ``impoverished'') version of the target text stripped of its pronouns), but to consider again the possibility of a pronoun-focused translation task, while attempting to solve the evaluation issues (trade-off between cost and accuracy) related to it.
